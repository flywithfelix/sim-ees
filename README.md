This project is an experimental simulation of an Entry/Exit System (EES) implemented in Python.
It is designed for research, prototyping, and exploratory analysis, not for production environments.

The simulation logic is based on discrete-event simulation using SimPy, with interactive analysis and visualization provided via Streamlit, Plotly, and pandas.
